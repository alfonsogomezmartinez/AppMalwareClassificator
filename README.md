# AppMalwareClassificator

This repository presents a proof of concept of the application of the proposed model in a Android app, which is named Malware Classifier application source code. It has been implemented as an Android application that uses the malware classifier model proposed using deep learning techniques. Malware Classifier app allows the user of the Android device to analyse applications prior to the start of its installation, which is why we classify it as static. Performing an analysis of the applications and identifying it as malware if it is. If so, it will classify it among the possible categories considered in the study. 

APK file is analyzed and identified as Malware, in such a case the type of Malware (<i>Riskware, Adware, SMS</i> and <i>Banking</i>) is classified. A menu is shown to choose the <i>APK</i> file to classify. 

A common use case is the analysis of a particular <i>APK</i> file. The first step is that the classifier prompts the user to grant permissions to access the files in the user's space. Once the user grants access to the app to access the files the list of possible files stored for analysis is displayed. The user selects the <i>APK</i> file to analyze by clicking analyze. From this point on, the <i>APK</i> file is packaged in a <i>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</i> and sent to the trained model that is loaded in the cloud. As shown in the figure~\ref{f:funcionamiento}, the model is loaded in <i>Flask</i> (a local <i>Python</i> server) and this is located inside an <i>Ngrok</i> that provides a bridge to the Internet. Retrofit is also used to consume the API that is responsible for the analysis of \textit{APK} files and process the response. Once the <i>JSON</i> is loaded in the cloud we proceed to perform a static analysis that allows us to obtain the set of features. These will be used to perform the classification using the trained model. This will provide the classification result that will be sent to the classifier, which displays the result in its <i>GUI</i>, as shown in the figure.
